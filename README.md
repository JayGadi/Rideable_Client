This app is a rideshare app designed for users to post rideshares, and find rideshares. This is a passion project of mine, but also helped me learn how to utilize a RESTFUL api, how to encorporate a MySQL server into an app and use MySQL workbench, and how to use the Hibernate ORM. It also gave me a look into how to use location services and the GoogleMaps API <br />

## My inpiration behind this app:

As a student from the Greater Toronto Area, studying at Carleton University in Ottawa, ON, travelling from Ottawa to Toronto, was extremely pricey and boring. The roundtrip cost of a bus ride is upwards of $150 dollars, which was really start to add up. Through classmates I heard of a service called ridesharing, where students look for drivers who are also going to a mutual destination, on social media, and Kijiji, and pay a fraction of the cost of a bus ticket to travel with the driver. Usually, they are also accompanied by other passengers, making a fun trip home. Seeing the UI on kijiji, I wanted to make a more rideshare centric app. Although the app is still underconstruction, some of its functionalities are up.<br />
